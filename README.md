# bastion-roman-andr-construct
A construction rehabilitation project backed by the European Union. It dealt with reahabilitation a fortress dating back to the 1700s.
I've built the website for the firm that won the project. They needed to showcase their work in progress and all the other
projects they've done in the past.
